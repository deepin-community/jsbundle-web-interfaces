Package: node-auth-header
Architecture: all
Multi-Arch: foreign
Depends:
 ${misc:Depends},
Description: parse HTTP auth/authz headers - Node.js library
 auth-header deals
 with obscene HTTP "Authorization" and "WWW-Authenticate" headers.
 .
 The HTTP "Authorization" and "WWW-Authenticate" family of headers
 are both pretty nightmareish;
 there has been, up until recently, no wide consensus
 about how they should be formatted
 and so parsing them is lots of fun
 if fun is pulling your hair out.
 .
 This library provides an implementation of RFC7235
 which allows for the parsing
 of many known existing authorization headers
 (like Basic and Digest)
 as well as any future ones which follow the standard.
 Noteably, this library is less strict than it could be
 to parse some of these legacy formats.
 .
 In addition to the format of the header itself being in flux,
 WWW-Authenticate has its own nasty surprise:
 sometimes multiple authentication prompts can appear in one header,
 sometimes they can appear in multiple headers;
 we _ONLY_ support the latter case
 since trying to disambiguate
 between a second prompt and parameters for the first
 is just about impossible.
 .
 This package provides auth-header usable with Node.js -
 an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.

Package: node-standard-error
Architecture: all
Multi-Arch: foreign
Depends:
 ${misc:Depends},
Description: subclassable standard errors - Node.js library
 StandardError.js is a tiny JavaScript library
 that simplifies creating subclasses of Error
 for custom error classes with the correct name and stack property.
 Saves you from writing a few lines of boilerplate.
 .
 This package provides StandardError.js usable with Node.js -
 an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.

Package: node-standard-http-error
Architecture: all
Multi-Arch: foreign
Depends:
 node-standard-error,
 ${misc:Depends},
Description: subclassable standard HTTP errors - Node.js library
 StandardHttpError.js is a very simple but useful error class
 for JavaScript that represents HTTP errors.
 You can then detect it with instanceof in error handling middleware
 and act accordingly.
 .
 This package provides StandardHttpError.js usable with Node.js -
 an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.

Package: node-webidl-conversions
Architecture: all
Multi-Arch: foreign
Depends:
 ${misc:Depends},
Provides:
 node-types-webidl-conversions (= ${webidl-types:Version}),
Description: web IDL type conversions on JavaScript values - Node.js library
 Webidl-conversions implements, in JavaScript, the algorithms
 to convert a given JavaScript value according to a given Web IDL type.
 .
 Web IDL is an interface description language (IDL) format
 for describing application programming interfaces (APIs)
 that are intended to be implemented in web browsers.
 .
 This package provides webidl-conversions usable with Node.js -
 an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
